# üß¨ Needleman-Wunsch Global Alignment Matrix

This repository contains an implementation of the **Needleman-Wunsch algorithm**, a classic **Dynamic Programming** approach used for **Global Sequence Alignment** in bioinformatics.  

Global alignment ensures that **two sequences are compared from start to end**, considering **matches, mismatches, and gaps** to find the optimal alignment.

## üìå Features
- Implements the **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm** in Python  
- Supports customizable **scoring scheme**:
  - Match reward  
  - Mismatch penalty  
  - Gap penalty  
- Builds the **alignment matrix** step by step  
- Can be extended to perform **traceback** and output aligned sequences
